## About the Game

The Two Fates is an interactive story about a noble faced with a dilemma whose actions could affect their future, and the answers reveal themselves as their journey progresses. Players collect materials and interact with future allies as they determine whether to follow a benevolent god or their closest friend. Inspired by the "Fire Emblem" series, The Two Fates asks just two questions--what type of noble will you be, and where will your actions lead you and your people? Freedom or destruction, what happens in the end is up to you.
